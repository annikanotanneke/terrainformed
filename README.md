# TERRAINFORMED

# Description<br>
This project, TERRAINFORMED, exists to investigate and examine humanityâ€™s relationship with space and the infrastructure we have created to tame what is beyond our wildest imaginations. This project was inspired by my own ignorance of how quickly commercial space travel has developed in the last few decades, and my desire to help people become better informed about how the advent of the commercial space age will change our lives on an environmental, economic, and ethical level.<br>

*insert additional research background*<br>

# Project Structure<br>
It is important to know that this project has a **dual structure.** It is not only about keeping Terra Informed (ha!), but also about navigating the Terrain Formed by companies such as SpaceX and RocketLab. The dual structure works as follows:<br>

1) Terra Informed<br>
This is where the bulk of my research regarding commercial space travel will be stored. It includes background information on the industry, the types of launch vehicles used, current and proposed spaceport locations, and any relevant information regarding this issue. I am trying to keep it as up to date as possible!<br>

2) Terrain Formed<br>
This section of my project will host my speculative design work, which will invite viewers to engage in what it might look like if we refuse to insert ourselves into conversations about where we construct spaceports, what we should launch, and if humanity should even be in space at all. <br>

# Additional Infromation<br>
I haven't gotten here yet! :')
