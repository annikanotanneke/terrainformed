            <h2 id="manifesto">Project Manifesto</h2>
                <p>Space… the final frontier… may be closer to home than any of us ever expected. With the rapid advancement of rocket technology in the past fifty years, the expanse beyond Earth's upper atmosphere is more accessible than ever before. Of course, in our ever-capitalist society, this means … Add spaceport intro The space race has taken on a new life, and instead of the US competing with other countries for a piece of the action, it's now competing with… itself? Gap. Explain space-for-earth. Becoming a “space harbor” for these ships promises a foothold into this rapidly developing economy, causing several states &ndash; namely, Georgia, Maine, and Michigan — to pour money and resources into creating spaceports of their own. The Michigan Aerospace Manufactureres Association (MAMA) has been the primary lobbying force in making this a reality in the Mitten State. Alongside the Marquette County Commission (MCC) and bond trader Tom Baldwin, MAMA has set their sights on making Granot Loma and a number of other places in the remote Upper Peninsula the first spaceports in the Midwest. This could be potentially exciting news &ndash; if anybody actually knew about it.
                A significant recurring theme in this new space race is a lack of transparency…Add stuff. The lack of awareness surrounding the proposed Granot Loma spaceport is exacerbated by the fact that its location is in the Upper Peninsula &ndash; a place that is only thought of as a summer vacation spot for many Michiganders. Brief installation description? The insert project name seeks to confront the citizens of the Lower Peninsula with an issue that is “out of sight, out of mind,” despite it happening virtually in their own backyards. The insert project title is designed to prompt people to think deeply about the future of humanity's relationship with space and the environment, and what their role in it will be, because deserve to have a say in such a pivotal moment in human history, not just lobbyists and moguls.</p>

        <h3>Hi(gher)&ndash;Res Concept Sketches</h3>
        <p>These were made using the debris of the Long March 3B Rocket (an orbital launch vehicle) that fell in China. I used this rocket for reference because it is slightly shorter than the ones that will be used in Granot Loma, and since I do not have any other dimensions for those other than their height, I felt that the Long March 3B could be an adequate substitute for conceptual sketches.</p>
        <p>1. Debris Scale Demo #1</p>
        <p>This concept sketch was created to demonstrate the potential size of the debris I want to create for this project, and how people might be able to interact with it. Since it is unlikely that the final product will look exactly like this, I took heavy inspiration from the following reference image to ensure that I was able to properly show the scale of the proposed object.</p>

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to provide a public, interactive art installation that will allow people to confront the otherwise inaccessible elements of space travel that are already inherently tied to our lives. We rely on the services of these orbital launch rockets, whether it be for 5G internet or a fancy self-driving car, but rarely (if ever) have the opportunity to get up close and personal with the very vehicles that make such services available. This is a problem as Michigan very well could become center stage for the launching of these vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want this art installation to provoke discourse about humanity’s relationship with space as it evolves from exploratory to commercial, and underscore the value of “ordinary” people’s voices in monumental decisions, such as becoming the next a “hub” for space cargo runs. It is not my intention to sway people one way or the other – but rather for them to advocate for their own agency in this new territory so the decision is not solely that of millionaires and lobbyist organizations. Regardless if people leave my installation “pro” or “anti” spaceport, I want people in the Lower Peninsula an active stance in something that can and will affect their immediate future, as their northern neighbors already doing right now.
                </p>
            <h3>Rationale</h3>
                <p>
                    NOTE: INCOMPLETE
                </p>
            <h3>So What?</h3>
                <p>
                    I want to create a disruption in people's daily lives that is not scary, but instead thought-provoking. Placing a fake debris field (heavy on the fake &ndash; no smoke, no noise, the point is for people to approach the topic as neutrally and curiously as possible, then deciding for themselves what they think about it) will draw people in to investigate what happened. The site will simulate an investigation of sorts &ndash; not of the rocket but why it was in Michigan at all.  
                </p>
        <h2 id="install">Installation Description</h2>
            <h3>Medium</h3>
                <p>
                    This project will be an interactive art installation located in a public park in the Lansing area. The installation will be comprised life-size rocket “debris” made out of scrap metal. The debris will be structured in a way that people can freely interact with it how they choose &ndash; including touching, walking/climbing on (within reason), or simply observing. On the exterior/interior of some of the debris (depending on type), there will be phrases made up of text from the rocket name and graffiti, which are intended to prompt discussion specifically about the commercial space race. Next to each piece of rocket debris will be a sign that contains information about Granot Loma, MAMA, the impact of spaceports (both their benefits and potential drawbacks), and the Michigan Launch Initiative. 
                </p>
            <h3>Potential Location(s)</h3>
                <p>
                    I intend to install this art display in a green area of public park, in an area that will provide enough space for audience interaction.
                </p>
                <p>LANSING</p>
                <p>
                    Since Lansing is where Michigan's state government is located, I want to have this project to be installed in one of its city parks. At this time, I have identified Durant Park and Reutter Park as areas of interest for installation. Further information about the scope of this project is required before I approach the Parks and Recreation Department. Furthermore, if further research reveals that the spaces in these parks are inadequate, I may have to look elsewhere in Lansing.
                </p>
                <p>DETROIT / GRAND RAPIDS / MUSUEM</p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the success of this project, I would like to be able to reuse the installation and have it travel to major cities/locations like Detroit, Grand Rapids, et cetera, or create new space debris structures to stage in these cities. This, however, would require additional planning that would happen after the installation and use of the Lansing space debris project. 
                </p>
            <h2>Intended Audience Experience</h2>
                <h3>STEP ONE: Noticing</h3>
                    <p>
                        A family goes to the park to enjoy the sunny weather. The adults chat on a bench, the kids go wild on the playground, et cetera. It is, at first, a typical day at the park. But something is different about the park today. Just beyond the swingset, someone notices a hunk of metal embedded in the grass. It is so large, they can't believe that they didn't notice it when they first arrived at the park. Calling the rest of their family over, they go to investigate. 
                    </p>
                <h3>STEP TWO: Investigating</h3>
                    <p>
                        After approaching the object, it's still not totally clear what the family is looking at. Everyone is full of questions: Is that a real rocket? What's it doing in Lansing? Why haven't I heard about this? Fortunately, there is a sign placed in front of it, explaining that it is part of a public art installation, and that they are free to interact with it as they choose.
                    </p>
                <h3>STEP THREE: Interacting and Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now knowing that the rocket is supposed to be there, the family begins to interact with the installation. The kids, overseen by a parent, clamber around the fake debris and explore, while the other parent reads the sign to learn more about the art project and why such a thing would be installed in a park in the first place… The installation is a source of fun, curiosity, and conversation for the rest of the day.
                    </p>
                <h3>STEP FOUR: Pondering</h3>
                    <p>
                        After spending their time at the park interacting with the art installation, the family goes home, but the impact of the installation has not left them. They are left wondering what it would mean for actual rockets to be launched from Michigan, even if they are far north in the Upper Peninsula. Each family member ponders the meaning of the rocket.
                    </p>
                <h3>STEP FIVE: Action</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the days and weeks after visiting the art installation, the family tells other people they know about it. The parents their friends and coworkers, the children their friends at school. Discussion of the rocket and Granot Loma, ranging from shallow to deep, grows exponentially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, the goal of this installation is to provoke conversation and action. I consider any conversation about it to be a success, largely because nobody in my life is talking about it. I hope that this installation will facilitate conversation not only about Granot Loma and the issues surrounding it, but also about the dawn of the Commercial Space Age and what boundaries we should set for it.
