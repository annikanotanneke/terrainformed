        <p>With the promise of economic benefits and the fame-adjacent status hosting a spaceport could bring, many states in America are vying to establish themselves as hubs for LEO launches, chief among them the Mitten State.</p>
        <p>The Michigan Aerospace Manufactures Association (MAMA) has positioned itself as a representative for public-private interest in establishing horizontal and vertical launch sites in northern Michigan to open the midwestern state to the commercial space age. MAMA states that it wants to “Position Michigan as a viable space state by encouraging public-private partnerships to develop a space ecosystem that will positively affect the standard of living for all residents” (Michigan).</p>
        <p>Stats on $$ MAMA and the Michigan government has spent</p>
        <p>Michigan is an attractive location for space proprietors for an important reason. Due to its position between the North Pole and the Equator, launches from this state can produce “polar orbits” &ndash; an orbit that passes by both poles of the Earth &ndash; something that is “coveted by commercial satellite companies (Wilkinson, 2022). </p>
        <p>MAMA has 3 current initiatives it is trying to complete. The most relevant to this project is its Michigan Launch Initiative, which is “a public-private partnership dedicated to identifying and then creating three sites: horizontal and vertical launch facilities to provide low Earth orbit, or LEO, satellite launch sites. The third facility will be a command and control center to manage post-launch satellite operations” (Michigan).</p>
